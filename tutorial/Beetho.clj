;; Beginning with some of the ideas in Sam Aaron's example[1],
;; let's see about trying to get rid of the limitation on sequence
;; length.
;;
;; I'd like to create a composition outside the server in "beat space"
;; (play note N at beat B).  This should allow for composing notes via
;; an abstraction that a library like Leipzig [2] provides.  But,
;; there can be java-side timing troubles that will come when there
;; are two time bases (java vs. scsynth).  So, I want to send some
;; notes just ahead of time to the server which plays them with
;; precise timing.
;;
;; I think something like this provides realtime control of
;; tempo/timing with clojure abstraction:
;;

;;        |        ......|..|.......     "player"
;;        |        :play |  |      :
;;        |        :     V  |      :
;; timing |        : [FIFO buffer] :
;;   &    |        :      |        :
;;  ctl   |        :      V        :
;;  sigs  +---------->[note-synth] :
;;        |        :      |        :
;;        |        :      V        :
;;        +--------->[audio-synth] :
;;                 :......|........:
;;                        V
;;                      audio
;;
;; To start, the composer process creates and sends a few notes to the
;; fifo, until it becomes full.  N.B the composer will want to
;; schedule them to be played slightly in the future so the note synth
;; does not get confused.  The scsynth process would watch for valid
;; data and play the notes from the fifo at the proper time.  The
;; performer side uses a FIFO "full" signal to communicate with the
;; the composer.  When the fifo has room, the composer adds more notes
;; until your song is complete.  So, now you have the ability to
;; stream an endless song.
;;
;; The conductor controls coordinating the composition process and the
;; performance.  The conductor may adjust the tempo and other
;; performance information in real time, by using ctl signals.
